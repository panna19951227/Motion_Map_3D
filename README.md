## Introduction

The Motion Map 3D Network(MM3D) is consist of two network. The generation network can represent the content of a video with arbitrary video length by a motion map. The discrimination network can learn the discriminative information based on the motion maps.

## Requirements:

1. Python.
2. If you only use the generation network, you can only install C3D_v1.0.
3. If you want use both two networks, make sure that you have install both C3D_v1.0 and C3D_v1.1.

## Usage:

Will be availble soon.
